# Fake News Solution by RK304_Techclans

**In today’s century, when someone shows us the news, video or pictures of any event, how can we believe its authenticity? It seems that the public is losing their trust in media due to the lack of reliable reference of facts.**

* In today’s century, the free access to create and share information on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and other digital platforms has popped out a new problem of fake information, which created rumors around the world. And with advances in technologies like AI, digital animations and social engineering, the line between fake and authentic content is only going to blur even more.

* The hoaxes or false stories can destroy the reputation of any human or industries including politics, health, stock, sports and Finance.



<!-- ## Motivation

* Recent incident in Mumbai which caused a huge crowd at Railway Station due to Fake News.
* Migrant workers hoping to get back home had gathered at the station.They had hoped that the lockdown would end, but it has been extended till May 3.
* For example, in 2016, BuzzFeed News classified the most viral fake news on Facebook was “Obama had signed an executive order while banning the pledge of allegiance in schools nationwide.
  The content was intended to destroy the Obama’s position during the 2016 US elections
* Fake news can affect the nation as well as international relations. In 2017, Qatar’s state news agency declared that its Twitter account had been hacked and hackers published hoax comments to criticize aspects of the Arab Gulf and US foreign policy towards Iran.
*  Due to the false comments, neighboring countries like Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt broke diplomatic ties with Qatar. -->
